	* tests/test1_env.py, tests/test2_post.py: Updated to use rfile
	and wfile instead of input and output.

2007-02-07  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py (SCGIHandler.__init__): It inherits from
	StreamRequestHandler rather than from BaseRequestHandler.

2007-01-27  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py (SCGIHandler.handle): self.handle_request() is
	now inside a try clause. That method have to be implement by the
	user, so there is a change of something going wrong, in which case
	the server should close the in/out descriptiors as well.

2006-12-12  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* 1.1 Released

	* setup.py: Version bumped

	* tests/test1_env.py, tests/test2_post.py: Updated for using
	ServerFactory.

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py: Added new SCGIServerFork class implementing a
	forking server. So far I had only a Thread based one.

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py (ServerFactory): Added a new factory function
	to instance servers.

2006-12-10  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>
