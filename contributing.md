## Issues List

### Writing a new issue

So you found a bug, have a feature request, would like to see a functionality being enhanced or just have a simple question? Well -- that is just marvelous. Here is how you write a good ticket to make the process as easy as possible.

# Finding a suitable title

Give your issue a caption that is both, descriptive and precise. If your title makes it possible to grasp the meaning of your request, it is more likely to be read and successively worked on. But don't get to technical, that is the description for. Here are some example of good titles:

- #28
- #29
- #21
- #66
- #101

A rather bad title would be one of the following:

- #502 (Better: Random 504 gateway errors in reverse proxy mode.)
- #693 (Better: `cherokee-admin -u` throws: could not create socket.)
